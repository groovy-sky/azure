# Virtual Network Manager

## Overview

Azure Virtual Network Manager (VNM) is a centralized management service designed to simplify and enhance the operations of virtual networks in Azure. VNM allows you to manage, configure, and monitor multiple virtual networks from a single pane of glass. It provides consistent network policies and governance across your entire Azure environment.

## Main Components

**1. Network Groups:** Network groups are collections of virtual networks that share the same configuration and policies. These groups enable you to apply configurations and policies at scale.

**2. Network Connectivity Configuration:** This component allows you to define and manage the connectivity between different network groups. You can create configurations that dictate how networks within and between groups communicate with each other.

**3. Security Admin Configuration:** Security admin configurations allow you to define and enforce security policies across your network groups. This includes rules for network security groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall configurations.

**4. IP Address Management (IPAM):** IPAM helps you manage IP address spaces across your virtual networks. It provides visibility into IP address utilization and helps avoid IP address conflicts.

## First Steps with Virtual Network Manager

   - Navigate to the Azure portal.
   - Go to "Virtual Network Manager."
   - Select "Network Groups" and click on "Add."
   - Provide a name for the network group and select the virtual networks to include.
   - Click "Create."

2. **Apply Configuration to a Network Group:**
   - In the "Network Groups" section, select the desired network group.
   - Go to the "Configurations" tab.
   - Choose the configuration you want to apply and click "Apply."

### Network Connectivity Configuration

1. **Create a Connectivity Configuration:**
   - Go to "Virtual Network Manager."
   - Select "Connectivity Configurations" and click on "Add."
   - Provide a name for the configuration.
   - Define the connectivity rules between network groups.
   - Click "Create."

2. **Apply Connectivity Configuration:**
   - In the "Connectivity Configurations" section, select the desired configuration.
   - Click on "Apply to Network Groups."
   - Select the network groups to apply the configuration to and click "Apply."

### Security Admin Configuration

1. **Create a Security Admin Configuration:**
   - Go to "Virtual Network Manager."
   - Select "Security Admin Configurations" and click on "Add."
   - Provide a name for the configuration.

   - Click on "Apply to Network Groups."
   - Select the network groups to apply the configuration to and click "Apply."

### IP Address Management (IPAM)

1. **View IP Address Utilization:**
   - Go to "Virtual Network Manager."
   - Select "IP Address Management."
   - Choose the virtual network to view IP address utilization and details.

2. **Manage IP Address Spaces:**
   - In the "IP Address Management" section, select the desired virtual network.
   - Click on "Manage IP Spaces."
   - Define the IP address ranges and avoid conflicts.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage, configure, and monitor your virtual networks using Azure Virtual Network Manager.
